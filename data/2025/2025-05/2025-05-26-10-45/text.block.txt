This is an incident that  had occurred in the Weligama Police Divisio n in February 
2024. A Filipino N ational who had arrived in the country had lodged a complaint 
with the Weligama Police Station on 14.02.2024, alleging that a Sri Lankan man had 
assaulted him while he  was visiting the Weligama area.  
 
Moreover  in the video, Filipino N ational was doing a Vl og and while he was 
recording footage at a s urf training facility on the polena beach in Weligama, it has 
been revealed that an employee at the facility had objected to it and the foreign 
national had been assaulted and kicked by the person.  
 
Accordingly, on the same day of the incident, officers of the Weligama Police 
arrested the 24 year old suspect, a resident of the Po lena area in connection with this 
assault and  had produced him before the Matara Magistrate's Court.  This case is 
scheduled to be recalled for hearing in the Court on 11.09.2025.  
 
 
Sri Lanka Police is very keen o n tak ing necessary legal action  against the 
complaints reported to Police Stations and  videos circulating on social media 
regarding the problems  and harresments  faced by foreign tourists visiting the 
country.  
 
But the incidents where suspects have been arreste d and legal action has been taken, 
and the police have conducted investigations and taken the necessary legal action, 
are portrayed as incidents that occurred very recently or a few days ago is not good 
for the image of the country.  
 
Therefor e Sri Lanka Police will investigate these incidents and take necessary legal 
action against those who are circulating previous incidents to downgrade the image 
of the country.
